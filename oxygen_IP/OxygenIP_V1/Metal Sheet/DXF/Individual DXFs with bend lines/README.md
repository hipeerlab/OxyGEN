# Individual DXFs with bend lines

These are DXFs of the individual sheet metal parts with bend lines added for the bent parts.  The bend lines are on a separate layer named **Bending**.

One thing that was slightly changed from the originals was that the sets of three holes for the hinges on the **Outer Cover** and **Upper Cover** were moved 0.060 inch (1.52 mm) farther from the bend line to prevent the holes from "puckering" when the parts were bent.

These DXFs were created by [Kooima Company](https://www.kooimacompany.com/) for parts that were manufactured for the [Ventila](https://ventila.org/) organization in New York.

One thing to note is that, since metric thicknesses of stainless steel sheet are not so common in the USA, the following material substitutions were made:

**1mm:** Used 20 GA stainless steel (0.0375 in) (0.9525 mm)

**3mm:** Used 11 GA stainless steel (0.1250 in)	(3.175 mm)
